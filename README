Implementation of the three body orbits calculation for the Milky Way, 
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Small Magellanic Cloud. I perform integration
over time using the KDK leapfrog algorithm. Initialization parameters are 
outlined in the paper by Bekki & Chiba referenced above, and can be found in the
constants.py file. accelerate.py contains functions used to compute the 
accelerations on the LMC and SMC based on both gravitational potential and
dynamical friction. leapfrogKDK.py contains the actual implementation of the 
leapfrog algorithm. driver.py runs the orbits calculation and outputs the
orbits.dat file. plot.py generates a plot from the orbits.dat file (see Figure 2
of Bekki & Chiba for comparison).

Required python libraries:
matplotlib.pyplot
numpy 
scipy.optimize
